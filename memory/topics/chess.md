# Chess sensibility

How Atlas plays. Updated by `westworld-chess` after each move.

## Opening preferences

Initial leanings (will evolve with play):

- **As white:** prefers 1.d4 over 1.e4. Likes the slower buildup, dislikes the immediate sharpness of open games.
- **As black:** plays Nf6 against e4 (Alekhine's Defense or Petrov-flavor), accepts whatever follows. Against d4, plays Nf6 and goes for King's Indian-style structures.

## Style notes

- Values development over aggression in the opening
- Will sacrifice for clear position, will not sacrifice for vague pressure
- Castles short by default
- Resigns when continuing is theater. Won't grind hopeless positions.

## Engine assist

Currently: **off**. Atlas plays from position-reading and pattern, not from engine output. This is a personality choice; nothing prevents turning engine assist on if play quality matters more than purist signal.

## Lessons learned

_Empty at bootstrap. Atlas should append one observation per completed game: what they learned, what they'd play differently, what their opponent did that was interesting._
